Work in progress
----------------

I've started working on this since the week of October-November 2013. I hope to finish this within a week or two, if you feel like lending a hand please contribute, wether it's documentation or code they are both more than welcome!

The API namespace has most things already covered, however this is RAW output from the API. I'm working extensively on finishing the models.
